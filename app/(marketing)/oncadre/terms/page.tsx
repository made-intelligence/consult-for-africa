              By accessing or using CadreHealth (&quot;the Platform&quot;), operated by Consult for Africa Management Services Limited (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.

            <p>
              CadreHealth is a career intelligence platform for healthcare professionals in Nigeria. It provides salary data, hospital reviews, career readiness assessments, credential management, and professional networking tools. The Platform is not a recruitment agency, employer, or licensed career counselor.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900">3. Account Registration</h2>
            <p>
              You must provide accurate and complete information during registration. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must be a healthcare professional or a student in a recognized healthcare training programme to register.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900">4. Data Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
              We collect professional and career data that you voluntarily submit, including salary information, hospital reviews, credentials, and career assessments. This data is used to power the Platform features described in our <Link href="/oncadre/privacy" className="text-[#0B3C5D] font-medium hover:underline">Privacy Policy</Link>.

            <p>
              Salary data you submit is aggregated and anonymized before being displayed to other users. Your individual salary is never shown to anyone. Hospital reviews display your cadre and role type but never your full name unless you choose to make your profile public. We take reasonable measures to ensure contributed data cannot be traced back to any individual.
