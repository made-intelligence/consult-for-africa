 * The DFC Catalyst Series.

 * Doctors Foundation for Care runs a monthly session for practising clinicians.

 * passed, so nobody is invited to a meeting that already happened.
 *
 * A table would be overkill while this is one entry a month typed by hand. Add
 * the next session here when it is confirmed; the digest picks it up on the
 * following Friday with no other change.
